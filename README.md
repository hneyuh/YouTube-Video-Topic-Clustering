# **Project title: YouTube Video Topic Clustering**
This project aims to cluster YouTube video topics using various machine learning models, including K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Autoencoder, and Deep Embedded Clustering. The primary programming language used is Python.

## **Overview**
With the exponential growth of social media platforms like YouTube, managing and categorizing the vast amount of content has become a significant challenge. This project addresses this issue by employing topic modeling techniques to group YouTube videos based on their content.

## **Objectives**
* Data Crawling: Collecting a large dataset of YouTube video metadata.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
* Visualization: Using various techniques to understand the dataset better.
* Model Training: Implementing and training different clustering models to identify video topics.
## **Methods**
### **1. Data Preprocessing**

* Text cleaning (removing HTML tags, punctuation, and stop words)
* Tokenization and normalization
* Applying LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) combined with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for advanced text embedding
### **2. Clustering Models**

* `K-Means`: A straightforward clustering method based on distance to cluster centroids.
* `Fuzzy C-Means`: A fuzzy clustering method that allows each data point to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.
* `Autoencoders`: Neural networks used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.
* `Deep Embedded Clustering`: A deep learning-based approach for clustering that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments.
### **3. Evaluation**

* Comparing the performance of different models
* Selecting the best model based on clustering accuracy and efficiency
## **Results**
The models' performance will be evaluated, and the best-performing model will be selected for clustering YouTube video topics effectively. Visualizations such as word clouds and clustering plots will be provided to illustrate the results.
